# Overview of Project

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

1. Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
2. Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
3. Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in  and arrow functions.

5. Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.
